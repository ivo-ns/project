Jazz spans a range of music from ragtime to the present dayвЂ”a period of over 100 yearsвЂ”and has proved to be very difficult to define. Jazz makes heavy use of improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, and the swung note, as well as aspects of European harmony, American popular music, the brass band tradition, and African musical elements such as blue notes and ragtime. A musical group that plays jazz is called a jazz band.\r\n\r\nWhile New Orleans jazz has improvised ensembles, when jazz started becoming popular in the 1920s and demand was growing for larger dance bands, it became necessary for ensembles to be written down, particularly when a group included more than three...",

        "description": "Techno is a style of electronic dance music (EDM) that is predominantly characterized by a repetitive four-on-the-floor beat which is generally produced for use in a continuous DJ set. The central rhythm is often in common time, while the tempo typically varies between 120 and 150 beats per minute (bpm). Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines, sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations.\r\n\r\nThe first proto-Techno/Electro release was Cybotron's 'Alleys Of Your Mind' in 1981. That same year, a group by the name of 'A Number Of Names' released another important and influential song called 'Sharivari'. While both of those songs aren't pure Techno, they are the roots of the sound and a very important part of history.\r\n\r\nThe term Techno (specifically relating to the music genre) was first used on the 1984 EP by Cybotron called 'Techno City'. It was also used on the 1988 compilation 'Techno! The New Dance Sound Of Detroit'. Juan Atkins, one-half of Cybotron, was the first person to use the term to specifically describe the regional dance sound of Detroit. Atkins and the other purveyors of the sound - Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, and Eddie Fowlkes - comprise what is known as 'The First Wave' (pre-1988).\r\n\r\nOther notable early artists are Blake Baxter, James Pennington, and Anthony Shakir. The second wave of Techno artists, from 1988 onward, notably consisted of Jeff Mills, Mike Banks (of Underground Resistance), Carl Craig, Richie Hawtin, Rob Hood, Dave Angel, Kenny Larkin, Dan Bell, Drexciya, Stacey Pullen, Orlando Voorn, Kelli Hand, and Octave One (to name just a few).\r\n\r\nBeing a large and globally popular style of music, there are now many subgenres of techno, which often have their own Discogs tags. Use of these as opposed to simply 'techno' will bring further specificity to entries and prevent the overpopulation of techno itself as a tag.",

        "description": "Breakbeat is a primarily UK-based style that existed alongside and quickly became infused into hardcore rave/techno music, in turn leading to faster, more complex jungle and hardcore music. Breakbeat is characterized by a prominent, syncopated 4/4 rhythm constructed from breakbeatsвЂ”i.e., sampled drum breakdowns from rock, jazz, funk, and hip-hop music. Unlike jungle, breakbeat has very little variation or rearrangement of the drum patterns, and it is usually slower/mid-tempo, roughly 100 to 125 BPM, speeding up as the style evolved into jungle. The \"Golden Age\" of breakbeat was in the early 1990s.\r\n\r\nSome Discogs users apply the Breakbeat tag to any release that utilizes breakbeat samples, but such usage is contentious, especially for releases outside the 1988вЂ“1993 timeframe; the tag was originally intended to refer specifically to the pre-jungle/pre-hardcore music that was actually called breakbeat, or as a way to differentiate breakbeat-based techno from non-breakbeat-based.\r\n\r\nThere is no tag specifically for \"beats and breaks\" types of releases intended for DJs and music producers, nor is there a tag for other forms of dance music that contain funky drum breaks (aside from Breaks), regardless of whether it is made with samples, tape loops, drum machines, or played live. Some Discogs users nevertheless use Breaks and Breakbeat tags on these types of records, going back as far as 1982 for the first Jive Rhythm Trax release.",

However, as downtempo is loosely defined, it has become an umbrella term for a broad selection of music with moody tones, chilling to passionate vocals, crossover indie vibes, and mellow beats.\r\n\r\nUsage of the Downtempo tag for music from before c. 1989 or as a generic tempo descriptor is likely to be contentious. Users should also be aware of the wide variety of potentially better tags for more specific slow electronic styles.",

Founded by Alfred Lion and Max Margulis in 1939, the label focused on jazz and built an important catalogue of traditional jazz and swing recordings through the 1940s. Its earliest releases are now acknowledged as classics. In the 1950s it was one of the earliest labels on which bop musicians appeared.\r\n\r\nAfter the purchase by Liberty in 1965, more commercially-oriented music, including jazz-fusion, started appearing on the label. In 1975, then-owners United Artists Records launched a systematic reissue program of Blue Note's back catalog lasting until 1980. Around that same time, Blue Note became a label of EMI.",

Married to Ida Engberg.\r\nStarted DJing and producing around the middle 90's, he was interested in things like acid, gabber, speedcore, hard house and he made numerous records in those styles together with his good friend Peter Benisch under various aliases. After he met the local and fresh-born Swedish culture, he co-founded Planet Rhythm, worked in their record shop and moved towards analog techno, releasing at labels like Loop Records (4), Rotation Records, Svek and Primate Recordings as well. He released his first album at Planet Rhythm in 1996 Decoded and the (remix version Recoded in 1997).\r\nIn 1996, after he began to experiment with more distorted and raw sounds, he decided to sell his part of Planet Rhythm and founded Drumcode. At first, it was a primarily Swedish-only label with local colleagues like Jesper DahlbГ¤ck, Cari Lekebusch, Thomas Krome, Fredrick Almquist, Joel Mull and so on. Occasionally he invited international friends like Oliver Ho, Marco Carola and various more to the remix compilation Stand Down. Regarding to the previous, the small collective followed Adam on the more experimental road of sounds, earning themselves the often-mentioned reference as pioneers of the \"Swedish Techno\". Adam's third album Protechtion in 1999 was said to be an example to this sound. These experiments continued on sublabels such as Code Red, Truesoul in 2002 (where he released his fourth album Ignition Key) and Mad Eye in 2004. He invited more artists from Sweden with the likes of Hardcell, PГ¤r Grindvik, Patrik Skoog, Hertz and Henrik B; strengthening the \"Swedish Techno\" sound with compilations like Swedish Steel E.P. and Swedish Silver - 10 Years Of Drumcode.\r\nAround 2004, beside his open-minded friends like style-founder Richie Hawtin (or Plastikman), Henrik B and Jesper DahlbГ¤ck; he became a defining responsible of refreshing the techno sound with a more minimal approach. One of his first tries was the 17th project which have been followed with collaborations with the latter in this growing new direction.\r\nAround the end of 2006, began with the release I Want You by PГ¤r Grindvik, Adam extended the label worldwide and open to the new minimal movement. Beginning with artists like Perc, Ortin Cam and the uprising of digital distribution, he made the label more active with the number of releases.\r\nIn 2013, he let the label and his own productions not necessarily related to techno, with becoming open for tech, deep and progressive house. This turn was marked with the Swedish Silver Vol.2 compilation and began to push out releases in a monthly frequency. Beside the criticism received, he and Drumcode could remain successful definers in electronic dance music.",

        "bio": "Philharmonic hall, not jazz podium; Mozart festival not cult TV rock programme вЂ“ back then, Alon had not foreseen how things would develop: back then, in 1994, when his music teacher told the eight-year-old that the mandolin and the electric guitar were вЂњbasically the same thingвЂќ. This was a momentous deception that was to deliver to the world of music one of the most versatile mandolin players, lutenists and ensemble directors of the present day. In his concert programmes, Alon uses the lute, Baroque guitar, oud and other plucked instruments to give his audiences the most diverse musical experiences. The mandolin, which has survived the centuries and found its place in the most varied of music styles and cultures, occupies a very special place in his heart.\r\n\r\nHis many acclaimed recordings of Renaissance and Baroque works вЂ“ his album вЂњTelemandolinвЂќ was recognised in 2018 with an OPUS Klassik award вЂ“ have firmly established him in the public eye as a specialist for early music. His work with international soloists and ensembles such as Maurice Steger, Andreas Scholl, Lautten Compagney, NorwayвЂ™s Barokksolistene and many others attests to his reputation. That said, AlonвЂ™s guiding principle is a changing perspective. In other words: giving new life to existing material, as well as creating completely new works. \r\n\r\nThat is why Alon, as soloist and conductor, frequently brings contemporary compositions both to the stage and into the studio. He conducted the Munich Chamber Orchester in Markus StockhausenвЂ™s вЂњSymbiosisвЂќ, premiered as soloist with the Deutsches Kammerorchester Berlin Gilad HochmanвЂ™s вЂњNedudimвЂќ, and commissioned two new works for mandolin from Uri Caine for the Beethoven anniversary year in 2020. His current album and PENTATONE debut вЂњPlucked BachвЂќ is a journey through Bach's Cello Suites on six of his different plucked instruments. For 2023, when the mandolin is named Instrument of the Year, Alon is planning new collaborations and the commission of new works.\r\n\r\nLooking beyond the scope of a professional musician, Alon is an active member of Rhapsody in School, introducing classical music to schoolchildren of all ages. Furthermore, he supported the Live Music Now Foundation and has played in Daniel BarenboimвЂ™s West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. Animal protection is also an important issue for Alon; he has been an ambassador for the Pro Animale charity since 2021.",
